Wild West

Controls:
	W to move forward.
	A to rotate left.
	D to rotate right.

Development Environment:
	Developed on MacBook Air, Apple M1.
	Developed using Unity with editor version 2022.3.9f1.
	Build Settings:
		Target Platform:	macOS
		Architecture:		Intel 64-bit + Apple silicon

Biggest Challenge:
	Animating a quadruped. Required a horse reference to try and make the animation look 
	natural and aligning the legs at the start and the end of the animation cycle to create
	a smooth animation loop.

Area of Effort:
	Rig and animation. This was my first rigging and animation experiment and required
	self study in the process of IK skeleton rigging, keyframe animation, Blender to
	Unity exporting, and finally animation looping and playback in Unity using the animation
	controller.
